Instrum is a lightweight C++ instrumentation library designed to be built into your application and
turned on dynamically at run-time to gather performance related statistics.

To build it, install CMake (cmake.org) and in the instrum directory execute:

cmake .
make
make install (if you want to install it).

To use, include instrum.h and use the macros within. Look at testMacros() from test-instrum.cpp
for an example.
